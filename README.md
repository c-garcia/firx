# firx

A small piece of code to show what an Application Gateway is
after a question raised in the "Barcelona Software Craftmanship" 
Meetup on 2015-Nov-30. 

The example consists of two ring-based servers. The first one
`webapp` just waits for HTTP requests in the form 
`http://host:port/uppercase/word` to return a JSON map with `word` in uppercase form. 
The application, however, does nothing to block any request or to
optimize performance. Any well-formed request will be processed.

The second one, `appgw`, is the Application Gateway (layer 7 firwall,
WAF, etc). It is there to exemplify some of the features these systems tend
to offer. Among others, we show:

* request filtering: it prevents words defined as problematic to be processed. These
    ones are load at start up time by the server.
* performance optimization: it caches results.

The Application Gateway, therefore, is able to perform many functions that cross cut
several architectural layers in a tightly integrated way with the business logic provided by other 
elements sitting behind it.

## Usage

Open multiple sessions to start the different servers. Logging is sent to the console.

* Start the app server `lein with-profile webapp ring server-headless 3000`
* Start the app gw `FORWARD_PORT=3000 lein with-profile +appgw ring server-headless 4000`
* Raise a request on a allowed word `curl -q -L -o - http://localhost:4000/uppercase/guitar`
   * The result is not cached `{"status":"ok","cached":false,"text":"GUITAR"}`
* Raise it again
   * The result is cached `{"status":"ok","cached":true,"text":"GUITAR"}`
* Raise a request on a _non-allowed_ word `curl -q -L -o - http://localhost:4000/uppercase/disco`
   * Error is returned `{"status":"err","reason":"forbidden word"}`


## To do

* Many things, this is just an example
* For the sake of curiosity, measure capacity and see the impact of involving asynchronous frameworks.

## The name

Firx is a small, semi-hostile alien attached to the liver of Cugel the Clever, the main character in the _Eyes of Overworld_, a
novel written by Jack Vance. My favourite sci-fi author.
